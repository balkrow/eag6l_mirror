   ssh-pk-prv-gen.c
   
   Kludge: This file includes ssh-pk-prv.c two times. First when
   GENERATE is defined and then when GENERATE is undefined.
   
   The intention of this tweaking is to avoid linking of the heavy
   private key generation functions. If we just use keys generated by
   others, the linker can drop the generate functions, because the
   ssh_pk_provider_register is not called.
