 Outputs:

 Returns:
    MTD_OK - wrote successfully

 Description:
    Writes a 32-bit word to the Macsec register in 2 writes, first the low
    16-bits of "value" to the address "reg", then the upper 16-bits of
    "value" to "reg+1".

    Address is in format X.Y.Z, where X selects the MDIO port (0-31), Y selects
    the MMD/Device (0-31), and Z selects the register.

    If devPtr is set uses T unit processor to read/write
    MacSec registers indirectly as a workaround to an errata in the A0
    and earlier revisions of 88X3240/3220.

 Side effects:
    None

 Notes/Warnings:
    "reg" must be even, or MTD_FAIL is returned.

    Macsec registers must always be written in pairs, first low word, then upper
    word.

  Returns:

  Description:
        This function reads a specified field from a Macsec register.
        It first reads the register, then returns the specified bit
        field from what was read.

        It uses mtdHwMsecRead() to do indirect reads using the
        Macsec indirect read method outlines in the datasheet.

        It operates on 32-bit fields as defined in the Macsec
        datasheet.

  Side effects:
     None

  Notes/Warnings:
        The sum of fieldOffset & fieldLength parameters must be smaller-
        equal to 32.

        Reading a register with latched bits may clear the latched bits.
        Use with caution for registers with latched bits.

        To operate on several bits within a register which has latched bits
        before reading the register again, first read the register with
        mtdHwMsecRead() to get the register value, then operate on the
        register data repeatedly using mtdHwGetRegFieldFromLongWord() to
        take apart the bit fields without re-reading the register again.

        This approach should also be used to reduce IO to the PHY when reading
        multiple bit fields (do a single read, then grab different fields 
        from the register by using mtdHwGetRegFieldFromLongWord() repeatedly).

        "regAddr" must be even or MTD_FAIL is returned.

        This function is useful if you want to do 1 register access and then
